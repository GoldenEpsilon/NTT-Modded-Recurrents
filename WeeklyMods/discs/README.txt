This mod aims to make disc weapons a risky-but-viable weapon class, completely changing (for the better) how disc collisions and bounces work, and adding a total of 14 new disc weapons - from somewhat-standard pistols, rifles and shotguns to "elemental" launchers to charge-action, homing, and auto-targeting cannons to the truly devastating Splinter Gun Disc Gun.

Is to be loaded via /loadtext discs.
