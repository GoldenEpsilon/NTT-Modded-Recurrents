adds 5 weapon mutations to the game
(1 is a survivability mutation but its easier to market as a weapon mutation pack)

intended to allow mid-late game builds that arent spc+ushovel

and let you actually build for runs (taking 4 weapon mutations),
related, heavy heart will spawn after 5 weapon mutations instead of 3

also expands the flexibility of multiplayer mutation choices

and to allow players to create some of the stronger weapons commonly featured in older mods such as ultramod and chaosmod (hyper machinegun, plasma shotgun...)


pretty fun, not that over powered(still feels like you are actively playing a video game)


excited neurons- bullets bounce gaining 1 speed and 1 damage with each bounce (mutation art by _killburn)

powdered gums- hyper shells (also pop weapons)

compound elbow- bolts rebound off walls (mutation art concept by _killburn)

flaming palms- flames destroy enemy bullets, flameshells spawn more flames (melee alternative)

concentration- continue holding the fire button to charge energy weapons (acts like yv's ultra but the reload is frontloaded, it works with energy melee but they do the basic attack first to allow for reaction swings)

condensed meat- players are given a smaller hitbox (its actually pretty crazy how big the players default hitbox is) visually shown as a dot of your players outline color


also this pack when combined with only the base games mutations has every one of the WastelandKings characters showing up the same amount
