## Introduction

From the depths of a long forgotten cave in the desert, he emerges...

This is the Croc Man from Spelunky HD, recreated as a playable character for Nuclear Throne. If you've played the first game, you know all too well what this entails. If not...

The Croc Man has no active ability and very little HP. However, he doesn't take direct damage: the moment he would get hit by a projectile or enemy, he teleports away. This would make it impossible for him to be killed, except for the unfortunate fact that he might teleport into a wall, which will crush him or leave him eternally encased in rock, depending on your interpretation. The result is an unconvential character that wants to stay away from walls, rather than stick to them.

## Details

The teleportation process works like this: when you would take damage, it selects a destination a distance of 5 to 8 tiles (1 tile = 16 pixels) away in a random direction. If the destination is not in a wall, you will teleport there; otherwise, it will look up to 3 tiles distance to the left and right in an attempt to find empty space. If you have Throne Butt, it will also consider up to 3 tiles distance forward and backward. If empty space is found, your destination is adjusted. If no empty space is found, you will teleport into a wall and be killed, even through Strong Spirit.

There are two Ultra mutations: "The Ankh", which saves you from teleportation death once per loop by putting you back at the spawn point, and "TELEFRAGGING", which causes most* enemies in your teleportation destination to die instantly.

Since you don't take damage normally, the mutations Bloodlust, Rhino Skin, Second Stomach, Sharp Teeth, Stress and Strong Spirit are useless unmodified: instead, they each decrease teleportation distance by a third of a tile, decreasing the likelihood of you teleporting into walls.

*enemies that can't be telefragged are Crystals (cursed or not), Vans, and all bosses except Big Bandits and Lil' Hunter.
