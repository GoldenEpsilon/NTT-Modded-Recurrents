Thanks to anyone who helped me make the dummies on the Nuclear Throne Discord. You were a huge help.

If he doesn't load automatically, type into the game chat "/loadrace Dummy/dummy.race.gml" 

Made by Gator.

(addition from itch.io by pack creator)

Dummy - A character that can spam a dummy that can block enemy bullets, aswell as your own. It has the same HP as big bandit (100), but you can only have 1 at a time, so you'll have to use them wisely.

He currently does not have a thronebutt, ultras, or a passive, but they will be coming eventually.
If you like the mod, send some feedback, and if there is anything wrong with it that I can fix, just comment the problem and I'll get to it.
