This is a set of 8 mutations I made that don't really have a theme.

Eplanations of the mutations:

@dCompressing Fist:
  You need to use twice the ammo with each shot, but all your shots do 1.5x damage.

@yConfidence:
  You gain speed based on your HP/Max HP Ratio. It goes in a linear fashion from 1 to 0, 1 being full health and 0 being death.

@bDuplicators:
  Every time you use ammo, you have a %25 chance to not use the ammo.

@gGarment Regenerator:
  When you are at full health, you take half damage rounding up. (so a bandit bullet does 2 damage, but a rat only does 1.)

@rRocket Casings:
  Your bullets have their speed multiplied by 1.5, and their knockback doubled.

@ySloppy Fingers:
  You fire at 1.5x speed, but you have vastly reduced accuracy.

@sSteel Nerves:
  You have a %50, on any damage you take, to take one less damage.

@pUnstable DNA:
  Reset to level 1, keeping mutations, but you lose half your max HP.
