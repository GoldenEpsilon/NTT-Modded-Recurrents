Just a set of *seven crowns you can use as examples if you're just learning how to mod in NTT, or if you just wanna play with them. Only crown of balance has custom graphics at the moment, so look at that one if you want to know how that works. I may make more crowns in the future but for now it's just these. -Yokin

Edit: Added crown of bullet hell to the list.

Crown of Balance : Double health of <35 HP enemies, half health of >34 HP enemies.

Crown of Bullet Hell : Everything shoots double projectiles.

Crown of Carnage : Normal enemies spawn as their elite variant, if they have one.

Crown of Dogs : Enemies with <30 HP can become wolves, enemies with >29 and <130 HP can become Dog Guardians, and enemies with >129 HP can become one or more Big Dogs.

Crown of Plague : Reduced enemy projectile damage, but enemy contact damage insta-kills.

Crown of Stamina : Rads are now health, 50 rads = 1 health.

Crown of Torment : Friendly projectiles do +2 DMG, difficulty increases by 3 every level.
