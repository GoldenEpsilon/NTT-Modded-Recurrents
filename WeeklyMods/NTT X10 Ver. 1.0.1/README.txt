Multiply Mutation Stats by Times 10 for Nuclear Throne Together by MasterLuigi452.

Requires Nuclear Throne Together by YellowAfterLife to run it.

Special thanks to...

Saniblues, YellowAfterLife, Blaac, Jsburg, 9joao6, and BioOnPC for helping me code this nonsense.


Requirments...

NTT Version 9926 or higher is recommended for 60FPS setting compatibility.


Features of Mutation X10...

    All mutations have been multiplied by times 10.
    Including ultras.
    Coop is FULLY playable! Bring your friends and play some X10 together!
    Crown of Destiny X10
    Enemies have much higher health on loops.
    Bosses got juiced up on loops (Including Captain)
    New stuffs to discover until Loop 6!


Current list of bugs

    X10 Plutonium Hunger ignores Crown Vault's rad attraction, but only if the camera has Vault in sight.
    X10 Euphoria does not affect Elite Shielder's Plasma shots. I don't think this can be fixed.
    X10 Monster Style breaks X10 Bolt Marrow, but I believe this cannot be fixed. Let's just blame it on JW
    X10 Detachment for Melting breaks lots of mutations... Probably as a main feature, but do report anything suspecious

And probably bunch of others that I may have forgotten...

If you think something is a bug, please message me on Discord. You can find me hanging around at our main Discord server at mod_discussion chat room.


Possible balancing changes in the future

    Loop Health X10. Always need to keep an eye on this.
    X10 Gamma Guts. It HAS been nerfed quite heavily, but I may just nerf this thing to the ground.
    X10 Scarier Face also gets reduced effect on loop so it is not borderline broken, but may nerf it on loop harder.


If you think you have some ideas for balancing, I'm all ears. I will consider your input and see what I can cook up.
