This mod for Nuclear Throne Together allows you to play as Big Bandit, the first of 4 pre-loop bosses you face in the game, in the style of the Big Dog April Fools update. 

Passive: Starts at 100 HP, the same as the boss, and with his trusty BIG RIFLE that levels with him.

Active: Allows the player to charge up Big Bandit's signature charge, launching them toward their mouse and dealing tons of damage to those he hits.
