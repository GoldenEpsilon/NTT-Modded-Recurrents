This mod adds 5 new weapons, in two types. The gimmick of these weapons is they use all types of ammo and shoot out projectiles based on the ammo they consume.

Weapon List:
Blunderbuss
Super Blunderbuss
Chaos Minigun
Super Chaos Minigun
Hyper Chaos Minigun

Lots of fun to do as a challenge run, or they also spawn in balanced locations
